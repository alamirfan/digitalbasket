Python code of Digital Basket

Abstract: Billing/Checkout process at mall/shopping centre is time-consuming as each item has to be scanned for its name and price and for other information. This wastes a lot of time of customers and they feel distressed too.
We have designed a basket which will automatically scan the product information like the name, price etc. once the product is kept in it and will calculate the final price instantly. This will save a lot of time of the customers as well as the billers.
